# LegoGram - a molecular grammar, simple as LEGO

Molecular grammar is a new chemical language, a possible alternative to SMILES, allowing some new interesting features in computational chemical applications, like molecular structure generation or prediction.

LegoGram is an implementation of the molecular grammar, simple and ready to use.
